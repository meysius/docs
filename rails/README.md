# Ruby on Rails Cheat Sheet

## Definitions

* **Homebrew** is for downloading and installing open source apps on mac. It is an open source package manager. 
* **RVM** is a version manager for ruby which lets you have projects which work with different versions of ruby. 
* **RubyGems** is a package manager for installing plugins and libraries for use with ruby rails. 
* A **Gem** is a ruby code packed for easy distribution. RubyGems.org is a public gem repository.
* **Rails** itself is a gem.
* **Bundler** is a gem that helps your rails app to load the right ruby gems.
* **Rake** is a gem which will make tasks.


## Setup
* Install homebrew
* Install rvm: https://rvm.io/rvm/install#1-download-and-run-the-rvm-installation-script
* Find out the latest versions of rails and ruby: http://ruby-lang.org, http://rubyonrails.org/
```
$ rvm get head
$ rvm list known
$ rvm install 2.3.6 (or the version you want)
$ rvm list
$ rvm --default use 2.3.6 (or the version you want)
$ gem install bundler
$ gem install rails --no-document (for latest or specify a version: -v 5.0.1)
```
* You could have several rubies installed. For each, there could be several `gemsets` only one of which is active at a time.
```
$ gem list (gives list of gems in your active gemset)
$ gem update --system (update all gems)
$ rvm gemset list (list of gemsets for current ruby version)
```
* Install nvm using homebrew and then follow instructions outputed to activate it
* `nvm ls-remote` find the latest LTS version in the list and do `nvm install 10.16.3`
* To switch node version: `nvm use 10.15.0` and to make a version default do `nvm alias default 10.15.0`
## Create Project

```sh
$ cd /your/desider/path
$ rails new <name> (--api)?
```
## Install Gems
Whenever you need to install a gem, add to `Gemfile`:

```ruby
gem 'name'
```

Then do:

```sh
$ bundle install
```

If at some point some command did not work for your project you need to put ```bundle exec``` at front of it so that the command is executed in the context of the specific bundle of gems your project has.

## Rails Commands
* Run server
```
$ rails s (production)?
```
* Run console

```
$ rails c (production)?
```
* Help for generating stuff 
```
$ rails g 
```

## Views
* Insert ruby code in views:

```html
<% code %>
```

* Print value of an expression:

```html
 <%= expression %>
```

* Drop variables in strings:

```ruby
"the beginning ... #{var} ... the end"
```

* Generating links, images, forms, etc. using rails helpers:
```ruby
<%= image_tag('logo.png') %>
<%= link_to(name, target) %>
```
```target``` could be rails hash:

```ruby
{controller: 'x', action: 'y', some_param: 't', …}
```

### Layouts
You can create as much `html.erb` layouts as you wish in `views/layouts`. Then put `<%= yield %>` inside them to specify where you want html fragments to be rendered. In the controller class you need to specify `layout 'name without html.erb>'`. The default layout is called `application`.

### Partials
You can exclude similar html fragments from full templates and put them in a Partial file. Partials have `_` at the beginning of their name. The below code is used to yield a partial within a full template:

```ruby
<%= render partial: 'name_or_path', locals: {key: value, …}) %>
```

### Helpers 
Rails provide a very strong set of text, number, date and more helpers. Just search for whatever you want to do first, it is likely that a function already exists for that. You can also create custom helper functions to use in the views. There are also sanitize helpers. Consider using them. They are absolutely necessary.


## Assets
Put all asset files in `app/assets` for rails to be able to perform optimization processes for production environment. In development environment, rails directly uses asset files in `app/assets`. In production however, it will optimize all asset files and put them in `public/assets`. Different kind of assets are kept in different folders under `app/assets`. In all of them there is a manifest file called ```application```. The comments at the beginning of these files are the manifest and are used as input to the optimization process. If you wish to process asset files of a particular kind in a certain order, you must explicitly define this order. To do that, before `//= require_tree .` add `//= require <asset_name>`

## Controllers
### Rendering Templates
By default, each controller action renders a template in `views/<controller_name>/<action_name>.html.erb`.

To overwrite this default behavior, you can put render command in controller actions:

```ruby
render template: 'path/to/the/view/template'
```

The template being rendered has access to all instance variables of the action which are those with `@` at the beginning.

### Redirecting

```ruby
redirect_to controller: :x, action: :y
```
or 

```ruby
redirect_to 'google.com'
```
### Accessing Request Parameters

Request parameters can be accessed using:

```ruby
params[:key]
```

Rails 4 has a very strong way of passing parameters when instantiating model objects in controllers called **Mass Assignment**. You can create a safe parameter hash and pass it to model ```new``` or ```create``` methods using the ```require``` and ```permit``` methods:

```ruby
params.require(:user).permit(:username, :email, :password)
```

## Migrations
**Ignore if you are using mongoid** 
```
$ rails generate migration name_for_migration
```

In each migration ruby class, put an ```up``` and a ```down``` method. These methods must be in the mirror order of each other. 

In `up` method u can do:

```ruby
create_table :cards do |t| 
  t.string :name [, options]?	
  t.integer :student_id
  t.timestamps
end
drop_table :cards
add_column :cards, :name, :string
remove_column :cards, :name
add_index :cards, :student_id
add_index :cards, [:student_id, :course_id]
```

Available types include: 
```
binary, boolean, date, datetime, decimal, float, integer, string, text, time
```
Available options:
```
limit: size
default: value
null: true/false
precision: number (for decimal type only)
scale: number (for decimal type only)
```
Migration commands:
```
$ rails db:migrate:status
$ rails db:migrate
$ rails db:migrate VERSION=0
$ rails db:rollback [STEP=n]?
$ rails db:migrate(:up/down/redo)? VERSION=number
```
It is a good practice to add index on all foreign key columns and those columns which are used frequently to look up for a row of data.

If you have a typo in your migration code it will cause the migration run to abort and you will get stuck in a state where you can not either go up or down. In such states just comment those executed lines of the broken method and try running the migration method again.

## Models
### One-to-one Association
[Complete association reference](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/association_basics.html)

#### MySQL or Postgresql
```ruby
class Student < ApplicationRecord 
  has_one :card
end
class Card < ApplicationRecord
  belongs_to :student
end
```

You also need to add foreign key to the `belongs_to` side in the migration file:

```ruby
create_table :cards do |t| 
  t.integer :student_id
end
```

When you set `student.card` or `card.student`, rails automatically saves the relationship in the database. Also if you set any of these to nil you will break the relationship.

#### MongoDB
```ruby
class Student
  include  Mongoid::Document
  has_one :card 
  # OR
  embeds_one :card
end
class Card
  include  Mongoid::Document
  belongs_to :student
  # OR
  embedded_in :student
end
```

### One-to-many Association
#### MySQL or Postgresql
```ruby
class Course < ApplicationRecord 
  has_many :projects
end
class Project < ApplicationRecord
  belongs_to :course
end
```

You also need to add foreign key to the `belongs_to` side in the migration file:

```ruby
create_table :projects do |t| 
  t.integer :course_id
end
```

#### MongoDB
```ruby
class Course
  include  Mongoid::Document
  has_many :projects 
  # OR
  embeds_many :projects
end
class Project
  include  Mongoid::Document
  belongs_to :course
  # OR
  embedded_in :course
end
```

Then you can do things like:

```ruby
course.projects
course.projects << p
course.projects = [p1, p2, p3]
course.projects.destroy(p1) # destroys completely 
course.projects.delete(p1) # deletes from the list of projects
course.projects.clear
course.projects.empty?
course.projects.size
```
If you perform any modification on ```course.projects```, rails will instantly sync the database accordingly.

### Many-to-many Association
#### MySQL or Postgresql
```ruby
class Student < ApplicationRecord 
  has_and_belongs_to_many :courses
end
class Course < ApplicationRecord
  has_and_belongs_to_many :students
end
```

You have to generate a migration to create join table for this relationship. Rails naming convention for the name of join table is:

```
first_table + _ + second_table
```
(in alphabetical order)

The migration file should look like this:

```ruby
def up
  create_table :courses_students, :id => false do |t|
    t.integer :student_id
    t.integer :course_id
  end 
  add_index :courses_students, [:student_id, :course_id]
end

def down
  drop_table :courses_students
end
```

#### MongoDB
```ruby
class Student
  include  Mongoid::Document
  has_and_belongs_to_many :courses
end
class Course
  include  Mongoid::Document
  has_and_belongs_to_many :students
end
```

If you change the name of the relationship from its default name, you would have to configure the relationship in order for it to work as it should:
```ruby
join_table: :table_name
class_name: 'ActualClassNameInCaseYouChangeTheRelationshipKey'
foreign_key: :name_of_column_used_as_foreign_key
```

Again, If you perform any modification on objects in either side of such relationship, rails will instantly sync the database accordingly.

### Inheritance
Two main types of class inheritance:
- Single Table Inheritance
- Class Table Inheritance (https://github.com/mvdamme/dbview_cti)


### Create, Update, and Delete

```ruby
u = User.new
u.assign_attributes(hash) # Update without saving
u.update_attributes(hash) # Update and save
u.update_attributes!(hash) # Update and raise errors
u = User.new(hash) # initialize object
u.new_record? # has it been saved in the database?
u.save # save and return true false
u.save! # save and raise error
u = User.create(hash) # new and save 
u = User.create!(hash) # new and save and raise error
u.destroy
```

### Fetching Objects

```ruby
u = User.find_by(hash)
u = User.find_or_create_by(hash) # try to find, create if not found
User.all
User.first
User.last
User.where(hash)
User.where([“column_1 = ? and column_2 > ?”, a, b])
```
`where`, `order`, `offset`, and `limit` are query methods available to ActiveRecord class.

**Named Scopes** are to make use of the above four methods but in a nicer way. For that, just add scopes to a Model:

```ruby
scope :name, -> (params) { where(hash) }
```

and then we use it like:

```ruby
Model.scope_name
```
### Validation
List of validation functions:

```ruby
validates_presence_of 
# options -> :message

validates_length_of
# options -> :is, :minimum, :maximum, :within, :in, :wrong_length, :too_short, :too_long

validates_numericality_of 
# options -> :equal_to, :greater_than, :less_than, :greater_than_or_equal_to, :less_than_or_equal_to, :odd, :even, :only_integer, :message

validates_inclusion_of
# options -> :in, :message

validates_exclusion_of
# options -> :in, :message

validates_format_of
# options -> :with, :message

validates_uniqueness_of
# options -> :case_sensitive, :scope, :message

validates_acceptance_of
# options -> :accept, :message

validates_confirmation_of
# options -> :message
```
Global Options we can use on almost all of the above:

```ruby
:allow_blank
:allow_nil
on: :create/:update/:save(default)
if: :method_name 
# a boolean returner function, indicating whether or not the object should be validated
```

There is another way to write validations called **Sexy Validation**: 

```ruby
validates 
  :attribute_to_check,
  :presence => {}, # or a boolean
  :numericality => {}, # or a boolean
  :length => {},
  :format => {},
  :inclusion => {},
  :exclusion => {},
  :acceptance => {},
  :uniqueness => {},
  :confirmation => {}
```

Call `.valid?` on objects to check their validity. Call `.errors` on objects to see its errors. 

You can also add your own custom validation methods to the model:

```ruby
def :name_of_validation 
	# check validation criteria
	# finally do:
	errors.add(:attribute or :base, "msg") 
end
```

And declare this validation on the Model:

```ruby
validate :method_name 
# you can also add :on or :if options here
```

### Callbacks
There are:
```
before_create
before_save
before_validation
before_commit
before_update

after_create
after_save
after_validation
after_commit
after_update
```
If you want to see if any attribute has changed in `after` callbacks, use `self.saved_change_to_attribute?(:title)` and `attribute_before_last_save(attr_name)`
[Read here](https://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveRecord/AttributeMethods/Dirty.html)

## Cookies and Sessions
To set a cookies and session variables:

```ruby
cookies[:key] = val
session[:key] = val
cookies[:username] = {
  value: val,
  expires: 1.week.from_now
}
```

Session data can be stored in file, database, or we can use cookies to store them. Since we are sending information to the user's local machine we need a mechanism to check whether or not they are changed by anyone other than us. Rails use the secret key stored in `config/initializers/secret_token.rb` to validate the integrity of signed cookies. 

`$ rake secret` will produce new key for you which you can replace the old one with.

The configuration to make rails use cookies for storing sessions is stored in `config/initializers/session_store.rb`

## RESTful Routes

To see all routes of your app, do:

```ruby
$ rails routes 
```

Below is the standard list of RESTful routes:
```html
| URL                  | HTTP Method | Controller Action | Description                        |
|----------------------|-------------|-------------------|------------------------------------|
| /subjects            | GET         | index             | Show all items                     |
| /subjects/new        | GET         | new               | Show new form                      |
| /subjects            | POST        | create            | Create an item                     |
| /subjects/:id        | GET         | show              | Show item with :id                 |
| /subjects/:id/edit   | GET         | edit              | Show edit form for item with :id   |
| /subjects/:id        | PATCH       | update            | Update item with :id               |
| /subjects/:id/delete | GET         | delete            | Show delete form for item with :id |
| /subjects/:id        | DELETE      | destroy           | Delete item with :id               |
```
You can find routing configuration file in: `config/routes.rb`

## Building a RESTful Rails API
First, install this [gem](http://github.com/cyu/rack-cors) following instruction in its repo.

Then you need to add routes for your RESTful API:
```ruby
namespace :api, :defaults => {:format => :json} do
  resources :users, :only => [:create]
end
```

Then in controller actions you render json responses:

```ruby
render json: obj, status: 200
# OR
render nothing: true, status: 200
```

## Authentication
### MySQL and Postgresql
* Install `bcrypt` gem. 
* Add a column named `password_digest` on your users table. 
* Then simply add `has_secure_password` in the User model. What it does, is it adds a virtual attribute named `password` to that model. It also adds validation to check if `password` and `password_confirmation` are present and then whether or not they match. 
* Set plain password on a new user object and call save. It will encrypt this password and save it in `password_digest`.
* Check if user's given password is correct:
```ruby
u = User.last
u.authenticate('give password') # returns false or user
```
### Mongoid
* Install `bcrypt` gem 
* Add the following code to your User model.
```ruby
class User
  include Mongoid::Document
  include BCrypt
  field :password_hash, type: String

  def password
    if !password_hash.nil?
      @password ||= Password.new(password_hash)
    end
  end

  def password=(new_password)
    if !new_password.blank?
      @password = Password.create(new_password)
    end
    self.password_hash = @password
  end
end
```
* Check if user's give password is correct:
```ruby
u = User.last
u.password == 'given password'
```
### After Password is Confirmed
Put the username of the logged in user in session

If your application is only a rails api, you need to generate a Json Web Token instead of cookie session and send it back to user. To create this token, follow the instructions [here](https://github.com/jwt/ruby-jwt).

To check if user has logged in when they request for an action, first, add this method to ApplicationController:
```ruby
private

def confirm_logged_in 
  if <token is valid>
    return true
  else 
    render nothing: true, status: 401
    return false
  end
end
```

Now you have to add this line to all controllers to check if the user has logged in before an actions is actually run:

```ruby
before_action :confirm_logged_in, except: [:action_1]
# OR
before_action :confirm_logged_in, only: [:action_3]
# OR a combination of both :only and :except
```

- Edit your firewall to let incoming connection to port 22 (80 and 443) 
- Create file `config/nginx.conf` and paste the following and edit `appname`
```
upstream puma {
  server unix:///home/deploy/apps/#{appname}/shared/tmp/sockets/#{appname}-puma.sock;
}

server {
  listen 80 default_server deferred;
  # server_name example.com;

  root /home/deploy/apps/#{appname}/current/public;

```
- Issue deploy command from development machine
```
$ cap production deploy:initial
```
- Create a shortcut or (symbolic link) to `config/nginx.conf` in `sites-enabled` 
```
$ sudo rm /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default
$ sudo ln -nfs "/home/deploy/apps/#{appname}/current/config/nginx.conf" "/etc/nginx/sites-enabled/#{appname}"
```
- Restart Nginx
```
$ sudo service nginx restart
OR 
$ sudo systemctl restart nginx.service
$ sudo journalctl -u nginx.service -f (logging live a service with name)
```
You should now be able to point your web browser to your server IP and see your Rails app in action!
- If you make change to `config/nginx.conf`, commit, issue a deploy command: `$ cap production deploy` and restart nginx on the server: `sudo service nginx restart`
- You might need to add environment variables in production server to read db password or secret_key_base. To do so, add variables like below to `/etc/environment` and reboot the server:
```
VAR_NAME="value"
```
